# Device Projects

### Getting Started

Each of this folders signifies a different board/hardware build. Besides the code to compile/upload, they should include documentation about how to setup your board and parts to buy.

For newcomers, download/use the Arduino IDE and try out the projects with the `sketch_` prefix.

After that, download/use the PlatformIO VSCode extension, and go after the others. 

### Setup

`env.h` files are expected in the root of each project, unless you're on a PlatformIO project and env configuration has been set. Check the entry .cpp file for variables prefixed `ENV_` to see what you need.
